            I’ve decided to take the UnionMod Downloader offline for the public.
        </p>
        <p>
            After speaking with Union Mods, they clarified that while their Terms of Service don’t 
            specifically cover tools like mine, they prefer their branding not be used and that mods 
            should only be downloaded through their official platform. They’ve also confirmed that 
            any broken links should be reported directly to them so they can fix things for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, Union Mods mentioned that the old site will be removed once the new site fully 
            mirrors its capabilities so everything will eventually be handled officially on their platform.

            <strong>Thanks to everyone who supported and used the tool while it was available</strong>
